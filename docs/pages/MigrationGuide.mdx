# Migration Guide

## v1.8 to v1.9

Resium are fully reimplemented with React Hooks. There are possibilities that the behavior has changed in edge cases.

And some properties and types are changed, removed, or renamed. For details, please check [changelog](https://github.com/darwin-education/resium/tree/master/CHANGELOG.md).

## v0.x to v1

### Resium are fully reimplemented

New component lifecycle and new React Context API in React v16.3 are supported.

There are possibilities that the behavior has changed in edge cases.

### Changed: Entity description

Children of Entity component are no longer rendered as description. Use `EntityDescription` component instead.

Before:

```jsx
import { Viewer, Entity } from "resium";

const Component = () => (
  <Viewer>
    <Entity>
      <h1>Hello, world</h1>
      <p>This is test</p>
    </Entity>
  </Viewer>
);
```

After:

```jsx
import { Viewer, Entity, EntityDescription } from "resium";

const Component = () => (
  <Viewer>
    <Entity>
      <EntityDescription>
        <h1>Hello, world</h1>
        <p>This is test</p>
      </EntityDescription>
    </Entity>
  </Viewer>
);
```

Now only `EntityDescription` depends on `react-dom`.

### Decrepated: PropType

PropType is no longer used. TypeScript is recommended.

### Renamed / Decrepated: properties

See [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/darwin-education/resium/tree/master/CHANGELOG.md).

#### `url` or `czml` prop of Kml/Czml/GeoJsonDataSource

They have been integrated to `data` prop. Now `data` prop accepts URL string, Cesium.Resouce, and data object.

#### `onMount`, `onUpdate` and `onUnmount` prop

`onMount`, `onUpdate` and `onUnmount` prop have been deprecated as they violate React's custom. Use `ref` prop instead.

Before:

```jsx
const Component = () => (
  <Viewer
    onMount={viewer => {
      // some code
    }}
  />
);
```

After:

```jsx
class Component extends React.PureComponent {
  ref = React.createRef();

  componentDidMount() {
    if (ref.current) {
      const viewer = ref.current.cesiumElement;
      // some code
    }
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <Viewer ref={this.ref} />
    );
  }
);
```
